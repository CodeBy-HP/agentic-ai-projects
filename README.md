# LangChain Projects - Monorepo

## Overview

This is a monorepo containing multiple LangChain projects and experiments. Each project explores different aspects of LangChain, including agents, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and various AI patterns. The projects are organized across different branches under the `projects/` namespace.

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain** - Framework for building with LLMs
- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **Various LLM APIs** - OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers

## Projects

Each project lives on its own branch under `projects/`:

| Project | Branch |
|---------|--------|
| Hello World | `projects/hello-world` |
| ReAct Agent with Tool Calling | `projects/ReAct-agent-with_tool_calling` |
| ReAct Search Agent | `projects/ReAct-search-agent` |
| Agentic RAG | `projects/agentic-rag` |
| Documentation Helper | `projects/documentation-helper` |
| RAG Gist | `projects/rag-gist` |
| React Function Calling | `projects/react-function-calling` |
| Reflection Agent | `projects/reflection-agent` |
| Reflexion Agent | `projects/reflexion-agent` |
| Search Agent | `projects/search-agent` |

## Learning Resources

- [Edin Marco's LangChain Course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/langchain/learn)
- Various other Udemy courses

## Getting Started

To explore a specific project, switch to its branch:

```bash
git checkout projects/project-name
```

Each project contains its own README with specific setup and usage instructions.
